#What it does

It provides a sense of community and support for refugees trying to reach safety. 
Each user enters an anonymous message about their current location and their destination. 
The message can be about the people in the area, the food, etc. 
Based on the messages about the locations, the locations are marked as a positive or negative spot. 
Other users can then see whether this location is a good place for them to travel through.
